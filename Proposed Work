The system uses a coin acceptor machine which will detect for a valid coin. 
The coin acceptor is connected to Arduino board and it then connected to the
LCD display. If a valid coin found it signals the Arduino and the Arduino will
send signal to LDC to display the amount of time to be charged. The relay will
control the power supply to charger, after completion of time duration it will 
stop supplying power. The SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supply) in the charger used for
managing energy conversion. The LCD screen will show how much time left for the 
charging if the user wants to increase the duration of charging he needs to add 
another coin then the microcontroller adds the time in currently remaining time.

MODULES:
	• Input stage-To recognize and accept the valid coins
	• Controller-To control the voltage supplied 
	• Power-To supply the power based on the requirements
	• Output stage-To display the output information on screen
