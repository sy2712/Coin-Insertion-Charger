Coin Acceptor:
The coin acceptor device accepts the coin through coin insertion slot. The sensor inside the coin 
acceptor device will recognize and validate the coin based on the coin diameter. When the inserted
coin is validated, it sends signal to the Arduino for power supply otherwise the coin will be returned back. 

LCD:
LCD is Liquid Crystal Display. Initially it will display ‘please insert a coin’. When the coin is validated,
it displays the timing of charging and when coin is not validated it displays a ‘rejected’ message. LCD is 
attached to Arduino UNO and gets the status of the systems to display on the screen. 



Relay:
Relay is a switch that open and close circuits electromechanically. Relay control one electrical circuit by opening 
and closing contacts in another circuit. When the relay circuit detects the undesirable condition with an assigned
area and gives the command to the circuit breaker to disconnect the affected area. Thus protects the system form damage. 



Arduino UNO:
Arduino is an open source electronics platform. It is easy to use hardware and software device. Arduino Uno is a
microcontroller board that contains everything needed to support the microcontroller. Arduino does not need a separate
piece of hardware in order to load new code onto board, instead it uses a USB cable. Arduino board is able to read inputs-light
on a sensor, a finger on a button, turning on the LED etc. It has 14 digital input and output pins. 



SMPS (Switch Mode Power Supply):
SMPS is an efficient and effective source of power. It is a device in which energy conversion and regulation is provided by 
power semiconductors that are continuously switching “on” and “off” with high frequency. The switching regulator does the
regulation in the SMPS. It turns the current supply to a smoothing capacitor on and off. SMPS dissipates very less energy as heat.
